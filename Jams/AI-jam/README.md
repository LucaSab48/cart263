# AI Jam Project

This program is a continuation on my computer bully. Along with everything the computer bully was able to previously do, I added the sentiment AI model to predict if the text string from the users voice recognition is positive or negative. Depending on the percentage of either positive or negative, the computer bully gains or loses health. My initial goal for this project was to use teh sentiment model and the pitch detection model to make combating the robot more engaging, however i ran into an abundance of issues using the pitch detection model. After throwing everything I had at using pitch detection, from adjusting my code to downloading the CREPE model files, nothing was working. So i decided to simply use the getLevel method for a new audio in. However, that wasn't working either. So I've come to the realization that i cannot use a new audio in along with the speech recognizer. I decided to make the game anyways using the sentiment model, and tried adding some more dynamic features, like turning red when hit and a health status. After using the model for a while, I find it to be rather inaccurate and sometimes ridiculous. Nevertheless, it was a fun experience yet I wished I could've done more. Thank you for trying it out!
