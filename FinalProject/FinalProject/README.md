# Prototype of Final Project

This program is a continuation on my computer bully. Along with everything the computer bully was able to previously do, I added the handpose AI model to add another layer of depth in terms of the gamification of my simulation. I used the handpose AI model tutorial to add the basic structure I'd use when constructing a proper final version. I intend to add a bunch of cool features after I get the larger addition (new AI model and game), such as better graphics, sound FX, a title card, more in depth response system, etc.
