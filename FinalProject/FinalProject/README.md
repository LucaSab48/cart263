# Final Project: Computer Bully

This program is a continuation on my computer bully. Along with everything the computer bully was able to previously do, I added the a whole mess of new features. The biggest feature I added was definitely the pose games. I wanted my game to have more narrative as well which is another large improvement from previous versions. I wanted the user to have some choice in the game to make it more interactive and have multiple endings. I had so many different ideas going into this yet, unfortunately, I was not able to achieve a lot of them. The first main problem I had was with the killing game. I really wanted the user to be able to punch and kick the robot head, but I was unable to make the cool down time necessary between punches to work. I was also aiming for comic book eske panels to tell the story of this game. I did not realize how much work it is to story board and draw these comic panels and decided to just go for one image as opposed to 3 panels per transition. I was also looking forward to adding sound effects, but I simply did not have the time. There was so many more ideas I had and was trying (like making the head rotate in 3D while moving the mouse, having background music, having tips that would appear to help the player, having a loading screen, etc.) but I couldn't get it to work or I was low on time. I am happy with the result I produced however. I put a lot of effort into making a linear story with options and learned hpw to compromise my ideas for practical results. If I had a very long time frame for this project, I would've loved to really explore this game and refine it to its best possible result, yet I am content with the bones I've created for this game. The feature I'm most sad about not having in this game is the mario 64 type intro screen. I really wanted an interactive intro screen (which I compromised and did) where the user could stretch the robots face and it would turn in 3D to look at the mouse just like the mario 64 intro screen but no matter how hard I tried, turning a 3D canvas back to a 2D canvas or having both simultaneously was not working for me. The aspect I'm most proud of in this game is all the different endings. I made 4 distinct endings for the results of the two games. A lot of effort went into making this project and I had fun doing it. 

Here is some good info to know when playing this game: 
- You have to ask for the origin story 3 times before the state changes so the robot can give you a beginning, middle, and end line.
- Be ready to move around a lot so find a place with a decent amount of space
- Try to talk to the robot before just going to the next state, it's pretty fun
- I've been having an issue where sometimes, the speech recognizer won't work, but it happens rarely and i can't find an issue in the code that would cause it. If this happens, please just refresh your page. 

All of the art for this game is made by me except for these things here:

All of the code is written by me but I did modify some tutorial code based on these videos:

Thank you for a fun class with cool projects, and I hope you enjoy mine!
